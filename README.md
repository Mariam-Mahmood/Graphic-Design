# Graphic-Design
This repository contains my graphic design projects created mainly in **Adobe Illustrator** and **Figma**.  
It includes practice work such as **logos, posters, and UI/UX samples**.  

I am a Computer Science graduate with teaching experience, now focusing on building my career in **graphic design**.
